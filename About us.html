    <h2><U>DESIGN</U></h2>
    <br>
<p>The Arellano University seal was inspired by the heroic photograph of American marines raising the Stars and Stripes on the summit of mount Surabachi. The seal was prepared by the great artist, Vicente Manansala. The whole design is expressive of the faith of the Arellano University in the youth of the land as builders of the Filipino nation.</p>
<br>
<h2><u>MEANING</u></h2>
<br>
<p>The three virile young men—representing Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao, and depicted as raising the Filipino flag on the promontory symbolize the fortitude, the courage and the sense of social cohesion that the three main ethic groups of the Philippines should possess in the fullest measure, if we as a people are to realize our dream of a strong and united nation. Promontory. This gives a vivid impression of the rough obstacles that the youth have to meet and overcome in order to reach the goal of their ambition. The limitless horizon beyond the promontory signifies not only the boundless opportunities that this land of ours has to offer to its youth but also the infinite range of human knowledge. The cluster of three stars illuminating the heavens symbolizes either the three great branches of human achievement in the realm of learning and culture science, philosophy, and art; or three-fold ideal of education – the education of the body, the education of the mind, and the education of the heart. Without the beneficent guidance of this educational ideal, no man can hope to lay claim to a full and well-rounded existence. For he should not only possess the necessary skills and knowledge that would make him self-sufficient and capable of holding his own in a complex society; such skills and knowledge should also be governed by his deep sense of human values, by his sympathetic awareness of the world of nature and of men, and by the recognition of his part in the essential unity of creation. It is the implementation of this three-fold ideal of life and education that gives expression to the spark of godhood inherent within man, thereby fulfilling the promise of the centuries and sharing in that dream-of golden age of goodwill through out the world.</p>

<h1><u>History</u></h1>
<br>
    <img src="History of arellano.jpeg">
    <p>The late Florentino Cayco, Sr., first Filipino Undersecretary of Public Instruction and illustrious educator, conceptualized the birth and administered the growth of Arellano University.</p>
    <br>
    <p>This prestigious institution of learning opened in 1938 as the Arellano Law College, named after Cayetano Arellano, first Filipino chief justice. It closed in December 1941 until March 1945 under the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II. At the end of the war, this educational institution reopened in April, 1945 and was renamed as Arellano Colleges offering a two-year preparatory law course and the regular four-year law course, as well as a complete secondary education curriculum.</p>

<div class="awew">
    <p> Like the founder of Arellano University, Cayetano S. Arellano, after whom the University is named, had very humble beginnings and earned his way to the top through assiduous scholarship and hard work.</p>
<br>
    <p>Arellano was born in March 1847, in Orion, Bataan, to Don Servando Arellano, an adventurous  Spanish peninsular who tried his luck in the Philippines with apparently little success and to a fair damsel of the place, Doña Cristy Lonzon. Early on, the boy Cayetano was fascinated by language and the study of philosophy. His parents, despite lack of resources, managed to send him to San Juan de Letran in Intramuros, where Cayetano maintained himself as an agraciado or working student. After completing his secondary course, he enrolled at the University of Sto. Tomas, where he studied Philology, Philosophy, Theology, and Civil and Canon Law, in preparation for the priesthood.</p>
<br>
    <p>In 1862 at the tender age of fifteen years, he received the degree of Bachelor of Philosophy;  five years later, the degree of Bachelor of Theology. For some reason, Cayetano did not enter the priesthood but instead took up the study of law, an inclination that manifested itself even when he was pursuing studies for the priesthood. In 1876, he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Laws.</p>
<br>
<p>Arellano then proceeded to practice his profession until the year 1898. At the same time, he taught law at his alma mater, the University of Sto. Tomas. Students under him who later distinguished themselves in the profession, such as Francisco Ortigas and Valdomero Arhente, would, in later years admit that it was a great privilege and  a blessing to have been under such a master as Arellano. At about the time he began his law practice, he met Rosa Bernal, the daughter of the owners of the boarding house where Arellano was then staying. They were married after a short courtship.</p>
<br>
<p>From 1887 to 1889, Arellano served as City Councilor of Manila. Recognizing his competence, the government offered him the position of Civil Governor of the City of Manila, which he refused. This was at a time when the country was gripped with revolutionary fervor and this was the reason, perhaps, for his refusal of the appointment.</p>
<br>
<p>When the Philippine revolutionary government was established, he was appointed Secretary of Foreign Affairs. After the war against the United States collapsed and with the advent of American government, Arellano decided to cooperate with the new masters for the good of the country. He played a principal role in the organization of the courts and in the codification of the marriage and municipal laws and the rules of criminal procedure.</p>
<br>
<p>In 1899, he was appointed Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, the first Filipino ever to hold that position, in which he made a name for himself as one of the country's greatest jurists.</p>
