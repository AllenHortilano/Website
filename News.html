<p>The collaborative effort between Australian and Philippine healthcare institutions continues this year as ten Australian student nurses recently concluded a two-week community immersion in various local communities from December 4 to December 15, 2023. With the aim of fostering cross-cultural learning and enhancing healthcare capabilities, this unique initiative marked a significant milestone as the first-ever face-to-face community clinical placement post-pandemic. The student nurses were accompanied by their clinical instructor from Edith Cowan University in Perth, Western Australia, Mrs. Martina Costello, together with the Arellano University team of faculty and International Nursing Program students.</p>

    <p>The first week of immersion started with a tour of Child Haus and Concordia Childrenâ€™s Services, Inc. in Manila, wherein the ECU student nurses were able to interact with pediatric clients of the said institutions. On the following day, they traveled to the province of Pampanga to conduct a school nursing and medical mission to a distinct Aeta Community in cooperation with the Social Action Center of Pampanga, Inc. (SACOP). To complete the initial week, the ECU student nurses actively participated in the acute and post-operative care of clients across the lifespan at Dr. Jesus A. Datu Medical Center and Kapampangan Development Foundation, Inc.</p>

<p>To continue their meaningful engagement in local communities, the second week of immersion took place in Pangil Laguna where the ECU student nurses collaborated with the doctors, nurses, midwives, and barangay health care workers in conducting immunization programs, feeding programs, and home visits. This approach allowed them to have a closer look into the diverse healthcare needs and challenges faced by community members with different health issues.</p>

<p>The Arellano University team led by Dr. Emerita Mendoza, AU-INP, Director and Prof. Bernadine Navalta, AU Community Coordinator coordinated the placement to ensure the safety of the ECU cohort, AU-INP students and the community members themselves, as well as the educational exchange that underscore mutual learning between the two institutions.</p>
